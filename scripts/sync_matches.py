DEPRECATED: This script is no longer used.

The Vanguard League platform now uses a local ELO rating system
instead of syncing with Rankade. This file is preserved for reference only.

Use these endpoints instead:
- Manual player registration: POST /api/players
- Match entry: via check-in system and bracket generation
- Ladder/rankings: GET /api/ladder endpoints
